Introduction:


Hello! Greetings! My name is Tierra Doughty, or Tee for short. Welcome to my Personal Portfolio website! Let me tell you that this full-stack project has been a 2-year journey as university, work, and life has kept it from completion but alas! I designed this site in Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript, choose the color schemes, and started it all from scratch. Now that the introduction is out of the way, let me explain my backstory, how I got started in art and technology, and what I'm up to now! LETS. GO. I will try to make this brief because I still have more projects to finish :,).


Growing up:

I, Tierra Doughty, was born and raised in Temperanceville, Virginia. I knew early on that I wanted to be an artist. One of my first vivid memories of me discovering what imagination was is highlighted. Below you can download and read my This I Believe Essay that I wrote during my freshmen year of college where I went into detail about my passion for art.

In high school, I took a web design class that taught me HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Who knew that I would still be using that knowledge 9 years later to make my own website!

In 5th grade, every student was able to take a "Most Likely Career" quiz. My result was most likely to be a Fashion Designer which definitely fit me (especially as a child who watched way too many episodes of Say Yes To the Dress on TLC).  If you want to browse my technology or art projects, there are webpages dedidcated to both on my site.
