Introduction:


Hello! Greetings! My name is Tierra Doughty, or Tee for short. Welcome to my Personal Portfolio website! Let me tell you that this full-stack project has been a 2-year journey as university, work, and life has kept it from completion but alas! I designed this site in Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript, choose the color schemes, and started it all from scratch. Now that the introduction is out of the way, let me explain my backstory, how I got started in art and technology, and what am I up to now! LETS. GO. I will try to make this brief because I still have more projects to finish :,).


I got my start in Art when I was just a child. If you would like to read a more detailed retelling of the story, please feel free to download my "This I Believe" essay.

Growing up:

I, Tierra Doughty, was born and raised in Temperanceville, Virginia. Where is that exactly? Below is a map showing where its at.

In 5th grade, every student was able to take a "Most Likely Career" quiz. My result was most likely to be a Fashion Designer which definetly fit me (especially as a child who watched way too many episodes of Say Yes To the Dress on TLC). If you want to browse my technology or art projects, there are webpages dedidcated to both on my site.
