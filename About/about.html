                <p>
                    Hello! Greetings! My name is Tierra Doughty, or Tee for short. Welcome to my Personal Portfolio website! 
                    Let me tell you that this full-stack project has been a 2-year journey as university, work, and life has kept it from completion but alas! 
                    I designed this site in Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript, choose the color schemes, and started it all from scratch. Now that the introduction is out of the way,
                     let me explain how I got my start in art and technology, and what am I up to now! I will try to make this brief because I still have more projects to finish :,).

                    </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    
                    I got my start in Art when I was just a child. It all started when I was in Kindergarten, where we had different creative options during free time.
                    Who knew that playing with wooden blocks that day would lead me to discover the power of creativity for the very first time.
                    If you would like to read a more detailed retelling of the story, please feel free to download my "This I Believe" essay below.

                </p>

                <br>
                <p>Soon after, I began to love art class and looked forward to it during my time in school. 
                    As I grew up, I began to cultivate my passion by getting my own sketchbook and eventually
                    having my own art supplies. Once in 5th grade, every student was asked to take a "Most Likely Career" quiz. 
                    My result was most likely to be a Fashion Designer, which made my young, artistic self extremely happy. I knew I could do
                    amazing things with my art and the me that is writing this now is proof of it.

                    </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    High School brought on a lot of new changes! One of my classes was a 'Web Development' course and I did
                    not know what to expect (Honestly, I thought it would be boring because "it wasn't art").
                    When I realize web development involved making and being able to design your own website. My attitude change completely.
                    I was not the most tech-savvy and my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills were zero. But I did not let that stop me from 
                    wanting to learn more about using technology! I even practiced building websites at home!
                    It even allowed me to start thinking of future careers that would allow me to explore <strong>both</strong> of my passions.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In 2020, I got accepted into college and majored in Computer Science with a minor in Art, bridging both art and technology together as one.
                    Now, in my current role as a STEM teacher, I get to teach students how to use their problem-solving skills, creativity,
                    and technology efficiently! I want them to learn that "Tinkering with a computer leads to endless opportunities".
